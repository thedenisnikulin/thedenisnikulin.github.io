  <p>I&rsquo;ve been working on my terminal-only development environment for about 1-2 years already, and during this time, I&rsquo;ve established some common tools that I use on a daily basis, among which are Helix editor, Zellij, lazygit, and a bunch of others. These tools are 99% keyboard-driven, and in order to work with them, you have to know a bunch of keybindings, each having its own ones to get familiar with. I consider myself an above-average-level Vim/Helix movement user.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve discovered that there&rsquo;s a problem for me that may arise when using keyboard-heavy tools. In particularly stressful situations where you need to act fast (an example would be a production hotfix), I very often find myself having my head completely empty. Like, your muscle memory just gets wiped out in a moment, and you don&rsquo;t know how to do even some basic things. So the problem is that when I get into such stressful situations, I just forget the simplest movements and keymaps. Probably, I&rsquo;m having trouble with stress management, but that&rsquo;s still a thing when you need to act quickly in a stressful environment. What struck me recently is that there&rsquo;s no such problem for me in VS Code, because to use VS Code, you must know nearly zero keymaps or shortcuts. Its visual accessibility makes it a very good match for me in such situations. You just click your mouse on things you see, and it&rsquo;s all good. Having said that, this makes VS Code a perfect fit for me when under pressure.</p>
