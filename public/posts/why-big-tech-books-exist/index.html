  <p>Ever wondered why books such as &ldquo;Mastering Go&rdquo; (798 pages) exist? Like, does anybody really read them from cover to cover? I don&rsquo;t think anyone on Earth just picks it up and reads it like this, and if you want to use it as a handbook, why not just read the documentation instead?</p>
<p>Moreover, Go is by design a simple language, and learning it must be easy, and if you take this fact away from the language then Go becomes no longer Go, and its deliberate tradeoff of being simple (which is not free of cost) is gone.</p>
<p>Then why would you ever need a 800-page long book to master Go, isn&rsquo;t it, by the very fact, an opposite thing to the language design?</p>
